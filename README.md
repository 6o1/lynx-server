## Setup Development Environment

1. Import project as 'existing Maven project' into Eclipse (preferably Neon or higher version).
2. Install Spring Tool Suite (STS) plugin for Eclipse via Help -> Eclipse Marketplace.
3. Download [lombok.jar](https://projectlombok.org/download) and run it by typing `java -jar lombok.jar` in the terminal.
4. This will open up Lombok Installer where you have to specify Eclipse installation folder by clicking 'Specify location...' button.
5. Again, on the Lombok installer, click 'Install/Update' button and quit the installer.
6. Finally, close Eclipse and start it again (Simply restarting via File -> Restart does not work!)
